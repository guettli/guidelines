# My Guidelines

## Avoid to guess

Finally everything a human does is guessing. Nobody knows everything. But way too often we act too fast. 

## Ask questions

Since you don't want to guess, you need to ask to get more information. Ask, ask, ask. And if they laugh about you, then follow Schwarzeneggers rule #4: Donâ€™t Listen to the Naysayers.

## tame the advice monster

First listen. Then ask, then listen.

Don't give advices today. Maybe tomorrow. But today listening helps more.
